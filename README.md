A library of structural engineering calculations based on Australian standards which are commonly calculated using either excel spreadsheets or by hand.

Project goals:
1. Provide extensive testing such that outputs are reliable. 
2. Provide thorough documentation such that structural engineers without extensive software engineering training can clearly understand how calculations are performed, why they are written the way they are, what the intended use cases are, what the limitations of the project are, and how they can raise issues/contribute.
